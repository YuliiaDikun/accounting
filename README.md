# React company accounting app

---

This is my first react app. You can add a new employee, his salary, and his name.
At the top of the app, you can filter your employee list by name, salary, or promoted information.
Also, you can promote any employee in your app, and delete or mark an employee by clicking his name. All your changes have already been saved to Local Storage.

Please, enjoy the app!
